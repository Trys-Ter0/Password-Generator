 Javascript Password generator

 ## Project Description

 I was tasked with creating a Javascript password generator that will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. 
 Specifications:


* Generates a password when the button is clicked
* Presents a series of prompts for password criteria
* Length of password: At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
* Character types:
    * Lowercase
    * Uppercase
    * Numeric
    * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
* Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
* Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
